Description: This is a minigolf course with a windmill and some other obstacles. The hole is behind the Windmill.
I started off with making a windmill scene out of glut objects as a prototype for what I wanted my scene to look like. I tried porting to OpenGL ES for mobile game ,but that failed miserably. I started using Unity, Blender objects and the like ,but that wasn't working out how I planned.
I decided to just make this scene instead since it shows a little bit more of what I have learned. ALL the objects were made by me. There is no canned/glut objects used. The windmill is generated by a cube function called "brick"
as are the fence objects. Feel free to change the height of the windmill tower to how I created the main object.
Instructions to run:
1) make
2) ./minigolf
